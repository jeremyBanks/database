# x/database/sql for Deno, Version 0.1

**status:** draft  
**review:** [#3](https://github.com/jeremyBanks/database/pull/3)

## Background

x/database/sql is

## Objective

For the initial release of version 0.1

Provide a minimum set of APIs that are enough to be useful, but without much
sugar. We don't make any concrete commitment of stability until 1.0 but we would
prefer to avoid breakage if possible.

## Database Consumer Interface

This is the primary for most users.

## Database Driver Interface

Primarily asynchronous, but most methods have `Sync` alternatives that non-async
drivers may implement instead.

- driver.Driver
  - .open[Sync](path: string): driver.Connector
- driver.Connector

## Bundled Driver Implementations
